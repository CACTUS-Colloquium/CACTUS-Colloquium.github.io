## Directions and other information

  * We're on the first floor, which is not the ground floor. There's also a mezzanine area between the ground and first floors.

  * If you are driving, I recommend you park in the lot/garage of "The Varsity" apartments (Baltimore Ave.), which should be both cheaper and a closer walk than using official campus visitor parking. It's about $2 per hour. They will, however, ticket you quickly if your time expires (campus would also). Watch the signs so you park in the visitor and not resident section. Another viable option is the paid lot along Diamondback Drive behind The Hotel at UMD, which is also cheaper than campus visitor parking.

  * If you are using metro, it's about a 1-mile walk from the station to our building, or you can use the UM shuttle that runs every 10-20 minutes (no ID required). Here's the [schedule](https://transportation.umd.edu/104-summer). The closest stop is the Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel.

  * We have eduroam, so if you have an eduroam account you are all set. If you don't have an eduroam account, you can sign up for a 24-hour pass to the [umd-guest wireless network](https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=kb_article_view&article=KB0012824&sys_kb_id=f098e4dadb533c104cd4f36f29961949&spa=1).
