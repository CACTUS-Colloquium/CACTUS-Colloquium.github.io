## Location, directions, and other information

All events will take place at the University of Maryland (UMD) in the [Brendan Iribe Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brendan+Iribe+Center+for+Computer+Science+and+Engineering/@38.9890994,-76.9387086,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x89b7c7e9e636ed11:0x9aaf14503032f4a!2sBrendan+Iribe+Center+for+Computer+Science+and+Engineering!8m2!3d38.9890953!4d-76.9365146!3m4!1s0x89b7c7e9e636ed11:0x9aaf14503032f4a!8m2!3d38.9890953!4d-76.9365146), Room 4105.

 * If you are driving, I recommend you park in the lot/garage of "The Varsity" apartments (Baltimore Ave.), which should be both cheaper and a closer walk than using official campus visitor parking. It's about $2 per hour. They will, however, ticket you quickly if your time expires (campus would also). Watch the signs so you park in the visitor and not resident section. 

 * If you are using metro, it's about a 1-mile walk from the station to our building, or you can use the UM shuttle that runs every 10-20 minutes (no ID required). Here's the [schedule](https://transportation.umd.edu/104). The closest stop is the Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel.

 * We have eduroam, so if you have an eduroam account you are all set. If you don't have an eduroam account, you can sign up for a 24-hour pass to the [umd-guest wireless network](https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=e790d31b473dae506543bb2c016d431d). 

If you are seeking hotel accommodations, we have minor discounts available at local hotels, please ask Michelle for details.
