title: Inaugural Meeting - December 14, 2021

The CATCUS/P Colloquium is a new regional event for the Capital Area (and broader friends) to gather and discuss recent results in Usable Security and Privacy. The Colloquium will consist of both research talks and networking events, and will be hosted twice a year.

* Register for the inaugural event [here](https://go.umd.edu/cactus-f21)

We will soon post a schedule for the day, but for now save the date for 12/14/2021 at the University of Maryland, College Park.

## Directions and other information
  * The Iribe Center uses European floor numbers, so we're on the first floor but not the ground floor. There's also a mezzanine area between the ground and first floors.

  * If you are driving, I recommend you park in the lot/garage of "The Varsity" apartments (Baltimore Ave.), which should be both cheaper and a closer walk than using official campus visitor parking. It's about $2 per hour. They will ticket you quickly if your time expires (campus would also). Watch the signs so you park in the visitor and not resident section.

  * If you are using metro, it's about a 1-mile walk from the station to our building, or you can use the UM shuttle that runs every 10-20 minutes (no ID required). Here's the [schedule](https://transportation.umd.edu/shuttle-um/104/611). The closest stop is the Glenn L. Martin wind tunnel but the Math slip isn't much farther.

  * We have eduroam, so if you have an eduroam account you are all set. If you don't have an eduroam account, you can sign up for a 24-hour pass to the [umd-guest wireless network](https://itsupport.umd.edu/itsupport?id=kb_article_view&article=KB0012824&sys_kb_id=f098e4dadb533c104cd4f36f29961949&spa=1).
