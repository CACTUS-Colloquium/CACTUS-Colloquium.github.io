## Directions and other information

Transportation information is available [here](https://www.georgetown.edu/plan-your-visit/#driving), including information for driving and transit. 

Visitor parking information for Georgetown is available [here](https://transportation.georgetown.edu/driving-and-parking/#VisitorParking). The daily rate is $25. There is some street parking around the Georgetown campus, although much of it is limited to 2 hours and longer-term meters can be hard to find. We hear that in Burleith (near 37th and S), ticketing is "pretty light," but of course that is at your own risk. 

## Sponsors

We wish to thank the Georgetown University Department of Computer Science for their support to make this event happen.
